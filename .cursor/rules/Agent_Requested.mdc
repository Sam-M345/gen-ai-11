## Minimalist Code Refactoring Guidelines for Cursor AI## Core Principles

### 1. Markup Minimization
- Eliminate unnecessary nested elements
- Remove redundant wrapper divs
- Modify existing elements before creating new ones
- Repurpose underutilized elements rather than adding new containers

### 2. CSS Consolidation
- Combine related styles into existing selectors
- Extend current class functionality instead of creating new classes
- Use inheritance and cascading to reduce rule repetition
- Modify existing classes to accommodate new requirements

### 3. DRY Implementation
- Identify and consolidate identical styling patterns
- Reuse existing components before creating new ones
- Extend functionality of existing components when possible
- Leverage CSS variables to maintain consistency

### 4. Structural Optimization
- Flatten nested structures without changing functionality
- Assess if existing parent elements can handle child element responsibilities
- Combine adjacent elements serving similar purposes
- Question every layer of nesting to determine if it's truly necessary

## Implementation Strategy

Always prioritize:
1. Modifying existing elements over creating new ones
2. Extending current classes before introducing new ones
3. Maintaining the absolute minimum number of containers, wrappers, and functions
4. Challenging each element's necessity before preserving it
5. Using semantic HTML elements with proper attributes instead of generic containers

Remember: The most efficient code is often the code you don't write. Seek to reduce, reuse, and repurpose before adding anything new.
